# Build relective view with ExtJS view builder

ExtJS View Builder is an Eclipse plug-in to help build GUI/views for ExtJS applications. 

You can drag & drop components to visually build your GUI - easy and fun just like playing Lego!  And what you see during "play" is what you will get at run time. 

Another cool feature is the plug-in can be used to build reflective views.  A reflective view reflects back-end data model and supports auto data binding when it loads from or submits to back-end.  The plug-in provides a Wizard for creating reflective from Java Class that represents back-end data model.

Please refer to word document "Build relective view with ExtJS view builder.doc" for details.
